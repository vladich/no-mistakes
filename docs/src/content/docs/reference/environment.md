## `NM_HOME`

Override the data directory.

|         |                  |
| ------- | ---------------- |
| Type    | `string`         |
| Default | `~/.no-mistakes` |

When set, everything else moves under this root:

- Global config: `$NM_HOME/config.yaml`
- Gate repos: `$NM_HOME/repos/<id>.git`
- Worktrees: `$NM_HOME/worktrees/<repoID>/<runID>/`, unless [`worktree_roots`](/no-mistakes/reference/global-config/#worktree_roots) places a repository's run worktrees elsewhere
- Logs: `$NM_HOME/logs/`
- Database: `$NM_HOME/state.sqlite`
- Socket / PID / singleton lock: `$NM_HOME/socket`, `$NM_HOME/daemon.pid`, and `$NM_HOME/daemon.lock`
- Managed agent server PID records: `$NM_HOME/servers/`
- Local evaluation cases and registry: `$NM_HOME/eval/` (created by automatic collection or an explicit `no-mistakes eval` command)
- Managed service names get a short stable suffix derived from `$NM_HOME` so multiple installs don't collide.

A push is handled by the root that owns the gate it was pushed to, not by the root `NM_HOME` names. Git does not set `NM_HOME` for a hook, so the managed `pre-receive` and `post-receive` hooks would otherwise reach whichever daemon the pushing shell happened to point at - usually the default `~/.no-mistakes`, since the variable is normally unset. Instead the CLI resolves its root from the gate path the hook passes it: a gate always lives at `$NM_HOME/repos/<id>.git`, so the owning root is a property of where the gate sits. A push to a gate under one root therefore reaches that root's daemon even when `NM_HOME` is unset or names a different root. A path that is not a managed gate is refused rather than resolved against the default root, so `pre-receive` fails the push and `post-receive` stays non-blocking and records the skipped notification in the gate's `notify-push.log`. The daemon enforces the same ownership on its own side of both calls, refusing to admit or to start a run for a gate that does not sit under its root. Existing installs get this by updating the binary; the hook scripts are unchanged, so no gate needs regenerating.

## `NO_MISTAKES_COWTREE`

Absolute path to a `cowtree` executable that supports `COWTREE_ADD_DONOR`.
When set in the daemon's effective environment, run worktrees are created from
the registered working checkout using verified copy-on-write clones. Creation
fails if the donor, filesystem, or receipt cannot prove that at least one file
was cloned. A failed creation removes its partial worktree and reports bounded
tool diagnostics; if cleanup fails, the error names the remaining path. The
daemon also accepts `ATER_COW_COWTREE` when the explicit setting is absent, so a
hosted agent launcher can supply its pinned `cowtree` binary. Restart the daemon after
changing either variable.

|         |                     |
| ------- | ------------------- |
| Type    | `absolute file path`  |
| Default | unset (native Git)  |

## `NM_DAEMON_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`

Override how long a CLI client waits for an existing daemon socket to accept a connection before failing instead of hanging.

|         |                                                                                                   |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Type    | `string` (Go duration)                                                                            |
| Default | unset (falls back to the `daemon_connect_timeout` global config value, itself defaulting to `3s`) |

Takes precedence over `daemon_connect_timeout` in `config.yaml`. An empty, unparsable, or non-positive value is ignored and the config value (or its default) is used instead. The config value is read from the root whose socket is being dialed, not from the root `NM_HOME` names, so a push handled by the root that owns the gate also waits for the timeout that root configured.

## `FORGEJO_BASE_URL`

Canonical Forgejo web base URL used for provider discovery and forgejo-axi commands.

|         |          |
| ------- | -------- |
| Type    | `URL`    |
| Default | (none)   |

Set this for every SSH origin, because an SSH remote does not identify the canonical Forgejo web scheme, port, or path prefix. Also set it when an HTTPS origin uses a self-hosted hostname other than `codeberg.org` or one containing `forgejo`. Recognized HTTPS origins are detected automatically, including non-default ports and path prefixes inferred from the origin. When set, the host and prefix must match the repository's upstream origin; credentials, query strings, and fragments are rejected.

## `FORGEJO_TOKEN_<HOST_KEY>`

Preferred host-scoped token used by forgejo-axi for Forgejo PR and CI operations.

|         |          |
| ------- | -------- |
| Type    | `string` |
| Default | (none)   |

`HOST_KEY` is the uppercase URL host, including a non-default port, with each non-alphanumeric ASCII character replaced by its uppercase hexadecimal code point between underscores. For example, `forgejo.example:8443` uses `FORGEJO_TOKEN_FORGEJO_2E_EXAMPLE_3A_8443`. Host-scoped names prevent credentials from being reused for a look-alike host.

## `FORGEJO_TOKEN`

Generic Forgejo token fallback. When present, no-mistakes passes its name explicitly to forgejo-axi; prefer a host-scoped token when the daemon serves multiple Forgejo instances.

|         |          |
| ------- | -------- |
| Type    | `string` |
| Default | (none)   |

Tokens remain in the subprocess environment: no-mistakes never puts a token value in command arguments and redacts Forgejo token values from surfaced provider errors.

## `FORGEJO_TIMEOUT_MS`

Per-request forgejo-axi timeout in positive integer milliseconds.

|         |          |
| ------- | -------- |
| Type    | `int`    |
| Default | `15000`  |

The pipeline context still bounds and cancels the complete subprocess independently.

## `FORGEJO_CA_FILE`

Path to a replacement CA trust bundle used by forgejo-axi for HTTPS requests.

|         |          |
| ------- | -------- |
| Type    | `string` |
| Default | (none)   |

This replaces rather than appends to the platform trust store. See [Provider Integration](/no-mistakes/guides/provider-integration/#forgejo) for provider setup.

## `NO_MISTAKES_BITBUCKET_EMAIL`

Bitbucket Cloud account email used for PR creation and CI monitoring.

|         |                                               |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Type    | `string`                                      |
| Default | (none; Bitbucket PR/CI steps skip when unset) |

Used alongside `NO_MISTAKES_BITBUCKET_API_TOKEN`. See [Provider Integration](/no-mistakes/guides/provider-integration/#bitbucket-cloud).

## `NO_MISTAKES_BITBUCKET_API_TOKEN`

Bitbucket Cloud API token.

|         |          |
| ------- | -------- |
| Type    | `string` |
| Default | (none)   |

Get one from [Bitbucket account settings](https://bitbucket.org/account/settings/app-passwords/).

## `NO_MISTAKES_BITBUCKET_API_BASE_URL`

Override the Bitbucket Cloud API base URL.

|         |                                 |
| ------- | ------------------------------- |
| Type    | `string`                        |
| Default | `https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0` |

Useful for mocking in tests or pointing at a proxy.

## `AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_PAT`

Azure DevOps Personal Access Token inherited by the daemon for non-interactive `az` CLI auth.
Alternatively, authenticate the Azure DevOps extension with `az devops login`.

|         |                                                    |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Type    | `string`                                           |
| Default | (none)                                             |

See [Provider Integration](/no-mistakes/guides/provider-integration/#azure-devops).

## `GITHUB_TOKEN`

GitHub token used to authenticate updater release asset downloads.

|         |          |
| ------- | -------- |
| Type    | `string` |
| Default | (none)   |

When set, the updater sends the token as a Bearer authorization header for release asset downloads. Version metadata is fetched anonymously from a GitHub release-asset manifest that is not subject to the unauthenticated REST rate limit. `GITHUB_TOKEN` takes precedence over `GH_TOKEN`; when neither variable is set, asset downloads remain anonymous. The token is not printed, logged, or persisted.

## `GH_TOKEN`

Fallback GitHub token used by `no-mistakes update` when `GITHUB_TOKEN` is unset or empty.

|         |          |
| ------- | -------- |
| Type    | `string` |
| Default | (none)   |

See [`GITHUB_TOKEN`](#github_token) for the updater's authentication behavior and precedence.

## `NO_MISTAKES_NO_UPDATE_CHECK`

Disable background update checks.

|         |                                                |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Type    | `1` to disable, anything else to leave enabled |
| Default | unset (checks enabled)                         |

Update checks run on every CLI invocation except `update` itself and version queries (`--version` / `-v`, which stay side-effect-free), fetch the GitHub release-asset channel manifest, cache the result in `$NM_HOME/update-check.json`, and print a one-line notification to stderr when a newer version is available. Dev builds (non-semver versions) suppress the check automatically.

## `XDG_DATA_HOME`

Data directory used to discover OpenCode transcripts for intent extraction.

|         |                  |
| ------- | ---------------- |
| Type    | `string`         |
| Default | `~/.local/share` |

When set, no-mistakes looks for OpenCode's intent transcript database at `$XDG_DATA_HOME/opencode/opencode.db`.
When unset, it falls back to `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db`.

## `GLAB_CONFIG_DIR`

Directory holding glab's `config.yml`, consulted when detecting self-hosted GitLab.

|         |          |
| ------- | -------- |
| Type    | `string` |
| Default | (none)   |

When the upstream hostname carries no `gitlab` marker, no-mistakes reads glab's configured hosts from `$GLAB_CONFIG_DIR/config.yml` to decide whether the host is a GitLab instance. It takes precedence over `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`. A selected [`forge_profiles`](/no-mistakes/reference/global-config/#forge_profiles) entry overrides this variable for that run and removes `GITLAB_TOKEN`, `GITLAB_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `OAUTH_TOKEN`, `CI_JOB_TOKEN`, `GLAB_ENABLE_CI_AUTOLOGIN`, `GITLAB_HOST`, `GL_HOST`, `GITLAB_URI`, `GITLAB_API_HOST`, `GITLAB_REPO`, `GITLAB_GROUP`, `REMOTE_ALIAS`, and `GIT_REMOTE_URL_VAR` from all child processes. See [Provider Integration](/no-mistakes/guides/provider-integration/#self-hosted-githubgitlab).

## `GH_CONFIG_DIR`

Directory holding gh's `hosts.yml`, consulted when detecting self-hosted GitHub Enterprise.

|         |          |
| ------- | -------- |
| Type    | `string` |
| Default | (none)   |

When the upstream hostname is not `github.com`, no-mistakes reads gh's configured hosts from `$GH_CONFIG_DIR/hosts.yml` to decide whether the host is a GitHub Enterprise instance. It takes precedence over `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`. A selected [`forge_profiles`](/no-mistakes/reference/global-config/#forge_profiles) entry overrides this variable for that run and removes `GH_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN`, `GH_HOST`, and `GH_REPO` from all child processes. See [Provider Integration](/no-mistakes/guides/provider-integration/#self-hosted-githubgitlab).

## `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`

Config directory used to locate glab's `config.yml` for self-hosted GitLab detection, gh's `hosts.yml` for self-hosted GitHub Enterprise detection, and tea's `config.yml` for Gitea detection.

|         |             |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Type    | `string`    |
| Default | `~/.config` |

When `GLAB_CONFIG_DIR` is unset, no-mistakes looks for glab's configured hosts at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/glab-cli/config.yml`, falling back to `~/.config/glab-cli/config.yml` when `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is unset.
When `GH_CONFIG_DIR` is unset, no-mistakes looks for gh's configured hosts at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gh/hosts.yml`, falling back to `~/.config/gh/hosts.yml` when `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is unset.
tea has no CLI-specific override env var (unlike `GLAB_CONFIG_DIR`/`GH_CONFIG_DIR`); no-mistakes always looks for its configured logins at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tea/config.yml`, falling back to `~/.config/tea/config.yml` when `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is unset. See [Provider Integration](/no-mistakes/guides/provider-integration/#self-hosted-gitea).

## `COMPACT_ADVISER_DISABLE`

Kill-switch injected into every pipeline agent subprocess so compact-adviser stays inert during unattended work.

|         |                                      |
| ------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Type    | always `1` for agent subprocesses    |
| Default | injected; not a daemon-wide setting  |

no-mistakes stamps `COMPACT_ADVISER_DISABLE=1` onto every spawned gate agent, including ACP aliases and managed agent servers that can load host plugins. Forge and profile overlays cannot drop the flag. The daemon process itself is unchanged; this is agent-child policy only, not a user-facing knob for the service environment.

## `NO_MISTAKES_UMAMI_HOST`

Override the telemetry collection host.

|         |                             |
| ------- | --------------------------- |
| Type    | `URL`                       |
| Default | `https://a.kunchenguid.com` |

When set, telemetry sends events to this host's `/api/send` endpoint. If it is unset in a dev build, `no-mistakes` also checks a repo-local `.env` file for `NO_MISTAKES_UMAMI_HOST`. If no runtime value is found, it falls back to any host embedded at build time and then the default self-hosted Umami instance.

## `NO_MISTAKES_UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID`

Override or enable the telemetry website ID.

|         |                                                                         |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Type    | `string`                                                                |
| Default | embedded in Makefile and release builds; unset in unembedded dev builds |

When set, telemetry uses this website ID at runtime. If it is unset in a dev build, `no-mistakes` also checks a repo-local `.env` file for `NO_MISTAKES_UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID`. If no runtime value is found, it falls back to any website ID embedded at build time.

When telemetry is enabled, `no-mistakes` sends command, run, approval, fix, and wizard events, completed step events with `awaiting_approval`, `fix_review`, or `failed` status, and pageviews for the human surfaces `/wizard` and `/tui` and the state-changing agent surfaces `/axi/run`, `/axi/respond`, and `/axi/abort` to Umami.
Mutation pageviews are sent alongside command events, so command status and duration remain available.
They include only flag-derived context: `/axi/run` records whether `--yes`, `--intent`, or `--skip` was present, and `/axi/respond` records the sanitized action and whether `--yes` was present.

Read-only surfaces (`axi` home, `axi status`, `axi logs`, `status`, `runs`) emit no telemetry at all, so agent status polling cannot flood remote analytics. Mutation surfaces (`axi run`, `axi respond`, `axi abort`, run lifecycle, approvals, and fixes) stay full-fidelity.
Each explicit human CLI, AXI, or TUI branch-sync check/apply attempt emits one command event and no additional pageview.
Its fields are bounded enums and booleans only: surface, mode, state, relation, target kind, pipeline phase, PR state, result, refusal reason, dirty state, and duration.
It never sends a SHA, run ID, path, branch name, URL, remote name, or command argument.

### What stays local and what leaves the machine

Everything sent remotely is low-cardinality: command names, statuses, durations, counts, flag booleans, agent names, fixed step categories, and - on the single terminal `run finished` event - the bounded performance rollup `agent_invocations`, `resumed_invocations`, and `fallback_invocations` (small counts only).
Run IDs, repository paths, branch names, session identities, prompts, model outputs, diffs, and per-invocation performance records are never sent.
Repository-declared [gate](/no-mistakes/reference/repo-config/#gates) labels stay local. Remote step, approval, fix, and failed-step fields record them as the fixed token `gate`.

Detailed performance evidence stays on the machine in the local state database (`<NM_HOME>/state.sqlite`): one `agent_invocations` row per agent invocation, plus each run's accumulated parked-at-gate time.
Each row records run and step identity, purpose (such as review/review-fix/housekeeping), the reported model and its provider, the cold/started/resumed/fallback session mode, a truncated session-identity hash, timestamps, duration, exit status, and failure category, alongside the session-fidelity metrics below.
It never stores prompts, model outputs, diffs, raw command arguments, secret values, or credentials - only bounded counts, low-cardinality categories, and durations.

Token counts and the additive session-fidelity fields are nullable and read back as unknown (rendered `-`) rather than a fabricated zero when the adapter did not report them, so a failed or cancelled invocation, a row written before a field existed, and an adapter that does not surface a datum stay honest.
A recorded `0` means the adapter reported zero; it is distinct from unknown.

- Token detail: `input_tokens`/`output_tokens`/`cache_read_tokens` (raw, cumulative across a resumed session for codex; per-invocation for pi; unknown when the adapter did not report usage), `fresh_input_tokens` (input minus cache reads), `cache_creation_tokens` (unknown when the provider does not surface it), `reasoning_tokens`, and `delta_input_tokens`/`delta_output_tokens`/`delta_cache_read_tokens` (the correct per-round amounts, so a resumed session's cumulative counter is never mistaken for one round's usage).
- Activity: `model_roundtrips` (a proxy for productive model turns), `tool_calls`, and a bounded tool-category histogram (`tool_wait_calls`, `tool_test_lint_calls`, `tool_edit_calls`, `tool_read_calls`, `tool_git_calls`, `tool_other_calls`); a compound command counts once per sub-command, so the histogram can sum higher than `tool_calls`.
- Timing split: `subprocess_wait_ms` is the wall-clock spent inside tool subprocesses; model/reasoning time is the invocation duration minus it, clamped at zero.
- Context: `workload_files`/`workload_lines` (bounded change size), `finding_count` (findings in the structured output), and `fallback_reason` (why a failed resume forced a fresh session, one of transient/parse/exit/spawn/unsupported/other).

The count and timing definitions live in one authoritative place (`internal/agent/invocationmetrics.go`).
Inspect the evidence with `no-mistakes stats --agents` (per-purpose aggregates, including a `METRICS` coverage count so a real zero is distinguishable from missing instrumentation) or `no-mistakes stats --run <id>` (one run's invocations, the per-round-vs-cumulative token split, and parked time).

## `NO_MISTAKES_TELEMETRY`

Disable telemetry collection.

|         |                                                                   |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Type    | `0`, `false`, or `off` to disable; anything else to leave enabled |
| Default | unset                                                             |

When set to a disabling value, telemetry stays off even if a runtime or embedded website ID is available.

## Environment the daemon sees

When the daemon runs through a managed service (launchd, systemd user service, Task Scheduler), the macOS and Linux service definitions include a default `PATH` with common user and system binary directories. They also bake in any proxy variables (`HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY`, `ALL_PROXY`) that were set when you installed or refreshed the service, so the daemon and the agents it spawns can reach the network through your proxy even when the login-shell probe is unavailable. Once baked in, the values are preserved across later service refreshes and restarts even when the proxy variables are not exported in that shell, so a routine `daemon restart` or a binary upgrade will not strip them; export the variables again only when you need to change or remove them. Both the upper- and lower-case spellings are forwarded exactly as you set them, because tooling is inconsistent about which it reads (curl, for example, honors only the lower-case `http_proxy` for plain-HTTP requests). Because a proxy URL can embed credentials (for example `http://user:pass@host`), the generated service file is restricted to owner-only `0600` permissions whenever proxy values are forwarded into it. When no proxy variables are set, the generated definition is unchanged and keeps the conventional `0644` mode. Windows Task Scheduler inherits your logon environment and needs no forwarding. At daemon startup, the daemon resolves environment once from your login shell on macOS and Linux (`$SHELL -l -i -c 'env -0'` for bash and zsh, run in its own session so an interactive shell never waits on a terminal), preserves your shell `PATH` order, and appends any missing well-known directories such as `~/.local/bin`, `~/go/bin`, `~/.cargo/bin`, `~/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `/usr/bin`, and `/bin`. When the login shell binary itself does not exist yet, which happens on macOS with nix-darwin when the daemon starts at login before `/run/current-system` has been recreated, startup waits for it with backoff for up to a minute before giving up. If login-shell resolution still fails or returns no entries, the daemon logs a warning and uses an augmented process-environment fallback that may omit version-manager directories such as nvm, fnm, or volta. Restart the daemon to pick up a login shell that appeared or changed after startup. On Windows it reuses the current process environment.

If your env vars aren't set in your login shell's rc files (`.zprofile`, `.zshrc`, `.profile`, `.bash_profile`, `.bashrc`, PowerShell profile), the daemon won't see them. Put them somewhere a login shell will load, then restart the daemon to pick them up.
