## Fields

### agent

Default agent for all repos and setup-wizard suggestions. Can be overridden per-repo.

|         |                                                                                             |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Type    | `string` or `string[]`                                                                      |
| Values  | `auto`, `claude`, `codex`, `grok`, `rovodev`, `opencode`, `pi`, `copilot`, `antigravity`, `cursor`, `devin`, `deepcode`, `qwen`, `acp:<target>` |
| Default | `auto`                                                                                      |

`auto` resolves to the first supported native agent or ACP alias in this order: `claude`, `codex`, `grok`, `opencode`, `acli` with `rovodev` support, `pi`, `copilot`, `antigravity`, `deepcode`, `qwen`, `cursor`, then `devin`.
`cursor` is an ACP alias for the `cursor` target with default command `cursor-agent acp`, and `devin` is an ACP alias for the `devin` target with default command `devin acp`.
With default paths, `auto` only selects an alias when both its command binary (`cursor-agent` or `devin`) and `acpx` resolve; `acp_registry_overrides.<target>` and `acpx_path` replace those respective defaults during availability checks.
`acp:<target>` uses the user-installed `acpx` binary to run an ACP target, for example `acp:gemini`; `acp:cursor` and `acp:devin` use the same default commands as `cursor` and `devin`.
`deepcode` drives Deep Code 0.3.1 or later with `--exec`; `qwen` drives Qwen Code in headless text mode. Both receive prompts on stdin, validate their final JSON against the gate schema, and never replay a failed turn. Deep Code inherits model and reasoning settings from its native user configuration; Qwen supports `agent_config.qwen.model` and inherits provider settings. Neither adapter claims project-instruction suppression: a trusted `disable_project_settings` policy refuses them.

Arbitrary `acp:<target>` agents are opt-in and are not considered by `agent: auto`.
The effective agent configuration must resolve to a runnable runner before a new validation gate starts.
If an explicit agent is unavailable, `auto` finds no native agent or ACP alias, or no fallback-list entry is available, the gate fails before its first pipeline step rather than reporting a partial command-only validation as passed.
`no-mistakes doctor` checks the global configuration, while every run repeats resolution after applying any trusted repository-level `agent` override.

You can also set an ordered fallback list:

```yaml
agent: [codex, grok]
```

The list is filtered to entries available to the daemon at run startup, and the first available entry becomes the primary agent.
After resolving `auto`, entries that resolve to the same ACP target are deduplicated in list order, so `cursor` and `acp:cursor` (or `devin` and `acp:devin`) provide one fallback and preserve whichever spelling appears first.
If no entry is available, the gate fails before its first pipeline step.
If a pipeline invocation fails because that agent process cannot start or exits with an error, no-mistakes retries that invocation with the next available fallback.
Fallback candidates share the invocation's existing bounded context and use only its remaining time; once that context expires or is cancelled, no further candidate is announced or started.
Structured findings and schema/output validation problems do not trigger fallback.

### acpx_path

Path to the user-installed `acpx` binary used for `agent: acp:<target>` and ACP aliases such as `agent: cursor` and `agent: devin`.

|         |          |
| ------- | -------- |
| Type    | `string` |
| Default | `acpx`   |

### forgejo_axi_path

Executable used for Forgejo PR and CI operations.

|         |               |
| ------- | ------------- |
| Type    | `string`      |
| Default | `forgejo-axi` |

A bare name is resolved from the daemon's effective `PATH`; an explicit path is executed directly. See [Provider Integration](/no-mistakes/guides/provider-integration/#forgejo) for setup and the [environment reference](/no-mistakes/reference/environment/#forgejo_base_url) for host and token configuration.

### acp_registry_overrides

Map an ACP target name to a raw ACP agent command.
When `agent: acp:<target>` matches an override key, no-mistakes runs `acpx --agent <command>` instead of `acpx <target>`.
ACP aliases use the same target keys. For example, `agent: cursor` and `agent: acp:cursor` resolve to the `cursor` target, so set `cursor` to override the default `cursor-agent acp` command; `devin` likewise overrides the default `devin acp` command.
Values are trimmed; a blank or whitespace-only value behaves as no override, so an alias keeps its default command.
Availability checks always resolve `acpx_path`. They also probe the executable named first in the effective non-blank raw command when it is a bare command name or clean absolute path. Relative, quoted, or escaped raw commands are not pre-probed; `acpx` executes them from the worktree. These checks do not invoke the ACP target or test its credentials.

|         |                     |
| ------- | ------------------- |
| Type    | `map[string]string` |
| Default | Empty               |

Example:

```yaml
agent: acp:local-gemini
acp_registry_overrides:
  local-gemini: node /opt/mock-acp-agent.mjs
```

For `devin`, an override is also the way to select a model slug from `devin models list` that Devin does not advertise over ACP, since [`agent_config.devin.model`](#agent_config) accepts only ACP-advertised ids:

```yaml
agent: devin
acp_registry_overrides:
  devin: devin acp --model <slug>
```

### agent_path_override

Custom binary paths for native agents.
When set, `no-mistakes` uses this path instead of looking up the binary on `PATH`.
ACP agents and aliases use `acpx_path` for the bridge; use `acp_registry_overrides` to replace a raw target command such as `cursor-agent acp`.

|         |                                   |
| ------- | --------------------------------- |
| Type    | `map[string]string`               |
| Default | Empty (uses default binary names) |

Default native binary names when no override is set:

| Agent      | Binary     |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| `claude`   | `claude`   |
| `codex`    | `codex`    |
| `grok`     | `grok`     |
| `rovodev`  | `acli`     |
| `opencode` | `opencode` |
| `pi`       | `pi`       |
| `copilot`  | `copilot`  |
| `antigravity` | `agy`      |
| `deepcode` | `deepcode` |
| `qwen` | `qwen` |

### agent_config

Model and reasoning effort per agent, in one common spelling. no-mistakes maps each field down to whatever mechanism that harness actually uses, so you no longer have to know each CLI's own flag.

|         |                                                                                     |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Type    | `map[string]{model, effort}`                                                        |
| Keys    | `claude`, `codex`, `grok`, `rovodev`, `opencode`, `pi`, `copilot`, `antigravity`, `cursor`, `devin`, `deepcode`, `qwen`, `acp:<target>` |
| Default | Empty (every harness keeps its own defaults)                                        |

```yaml
agent_config:
  codex:
    model: gpt-5.4
    effort: low
  claude:
    model: sonnet
    effort: high
  opencode:
    model: openai/gpt-5
  cursor:
    model: gpt-5
```

`effort` is one of `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`. The value is passed to the harness as written, so a level that harness does not implement is rejected by the harness itself rather than silently downgraded.

How each field maps:

| Agent             | `model`                                       | `effort`                          | Accepted effort levels                              |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `claude`          | `--model`                                     | `--effort`                        | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`             |
| `codex`           | `-m`                                          | `-c model_reasoning_effort="…"`   | `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`                  |
| `grok`            | `--model`                                     | `--reasoning-effort`              | whatever the selected reasoning model accepts       |
| `copilot`         | `--model`                                     | `--effort`                        | `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`  |
| `pi`              | `--model`                                     | `--thinking`                      | `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`  |
| `opencode`        | session-message `model` (needs `provider/model`) | session-message `variant`      | provider-specific                                   |
| `cursor`, `devin`, `acp:*` | `acpx --model`                       | not expressible                   | -                                                   |
| `rovodev`         | not expressible                               | not expressible                   | -                                                   |
| `deepcode` | native user settings | native user settings | - |
| `qwen` | `--model` | not expressible | - |
| `antigravity`     | not expressible                               | not expressible                   | -                                                   |

`opencode` needs the `provider/model` form (for example `openai/gpt-5`) because its session API takes the provider and the model as separate fields; a bare model name is refused at config load rather than dropped. Both of its knobs travel in the session message, not in the launch command, because `opencode serve` exits with usage on an unknown flag.

`rovodev` and `antigravity` have no mechanism no-mistakes can set - `acli rovodev serve` plus its REST session API take no model parameter, and the `agy` CLI parses flags strictly - so `agent_config` for them is a config error rather than a request that quietly does nothing. Reach for [`agent_args_override`](#agent_args_override) there if your build of the CLI accepts a flag. Reasoning effort is likewise unavailable for ACP targets: no-mistakes drives them through `acpx`, which exposes `--model` but no effort surface. acpx also accepts only the model ids a target advertises over ACP; for `devin` that is a subset of `devin models list`, and [`acp_registry_overrides`](#acp_registry_overrides) is the escape hatch for the rest.

`agent_config` is global-only. Like `agent_args_override`, it decides which model runs with your credentials, so an `agent_config` block in a repository's `.no-mistakes.yaml` is ignored. For first-class ACP aliases, `cursor` and `acp:cursor` share a profile, as do `devin` and `acp:devin`: the selected spelling's entry wins when both are configured; otherwise the other spelling's entry applies. This also applies to review-agent profiles.

**Precedence for unpinned runs.** `agent_args_override` wins. Opt-in [per-run Pi profiles](#per-run-pi-profiles) have a separate, immutable selection contract. If a raw flag already pins a knob natively - for example, `-m`, `--model`, or a `-c`/`--config` assignment whose exact key is `model` or `model_reasoning_effort` for Codex, plus the other harnesses' `--effort`, `--reasoning-effort`, or `--thinking` forms - then `agent_config` does not emit its value for that knob. Text such as `model=` nested inside an unrelated option's value is not a pin. Any knob the raw flags leave alone still comes from `agent_config`, so adding `agent_config` to an existing configuration never changes the arguments that configuration already supplied:

```yaml
agent_config:
  codex:
    model: gpt-5.4   # ignored: the raw -m below pins it
    effort: low      # applied: nothing raw pins reasoning depth
agent_args_override:
  codex:
    - -m
    - o3
```

### Per-run Pi profiles

Select a profile when creating a validation run, without editing global config:

```sh
no-mistakes axi run --intent "the user's goal" \
  --model openai-codex/gpt-5.4 --effort high
```

`--model` and/or `--effort` opt in. Each explicit field overrides
`agent_config.pi`; an omitted field inherits that global default. Both must
resolve to nonempty values before a run starts. Use a provider-qualified model
ID from Pi's catalog, not a bare name, URL, glob, or `:thinking` suffix.
Supported effort spellings are `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`.
Availability, authentication, and model-specific reasoning support remain Pi's
responsibility; no-mistakes does not inspect subscriptions or query quotas.

A pin applies to **every pipeline duty**, including reviewer and fixer roles.
The effective trusted agent selection must be Pi-only (no `auto`, non-Pi
fallbacks, or non-Pi `review_agents`), including `agent` / fallbacks from the
trusted default-branch `.no-mistakes.yaml`. That check runs before any active
validation is cancelled. Pi role-specific model/effort values are
superseded by the run pin. Native `--model`, `--provider`, `--models`,
`--thinking` (including `--flag=value`), or `--` in
`agent_args_override.pi` conflict at launch: move defaults to `agent_config.pi`
rather than combining two selection mechanisms.

The daemon resolves the values once and stores `runs.pi_profile` atomically
with run creation. That field cannot be changed or cleared. Each invocation,
retry, fresh review, resumed fixer, and daemon recovery uses that pin; later
global model, effort, agent-chain, role, or raw selection-flag changes cannot
replace it. Recovery still enforces trusted repository policies and refuses
unusable configuration or a missing Pi binary rather than switching harnesses.
The pin fixes selection parameters, not provider credentials, model-catalog
contents, or other agent settings; credentials are never stored in it.

Reattaching with omitted flags preserves the existing pin. Explicit fields must
match it; a different profile requires a new run. The same rule binds nonce
replays and receipt claims. `rerun --model ... --effort ...` selects a profile
for a **new** run; without those flags a rerun uses current global configuration,
not its predecessor's pin. Existing runs and all callers omitting both flags
remain unpinned and keep the previous global-config behavior. Concurrent runs
hold independent pins without modifying shared configuration.

Structured AXI status and daemon run/receipt responses expose `pi_profile:
{model, effort}` only for pinned runs. `no-mistakes stats --run <id>` shows that
requested profile alongside per-invocation served-model and usage evidence;
a pin is not a claim that a provider reported usage. These values stay local,
not in remote analytics. The CLI checks daemon support before a fresh pinned
submission, so an older daemon cannot silently launch it without a pin.

### review_agents

Optional, **global-only** harness and model/effort overrides for the review loop.
Repository `.no-mistakes.yaml` cannot set these profiles. Omitted roles keep the
normal `agent` selection and fallback chain; other pipeline steps are unchanged.

```yaml
review_agents:
  reviewer:
    agent: pi
    model: anthropic-vertex/claude-opus-4-8
    effort: max
  fixer:
    agent: pi
    model: google-vertex/gemini-3.8-flash
    effort: max
```

The role keys are `reviewer`, `fixer`, and their optional later-round overlays
`reviewer_after_round` and `fixer_after_round`. Each configured role requires one
explicit `agent` (the same harness names as `agent_config`; no `auto` or lists).
Model and effort are optional and inherit `agent_config` for that harness when
empty. Nonempty role values override that profile, but native
`agent_args_override` flags still win. Model availability, credentials, and
supported effort levels remain the harness/provider's responsibility.

#### Later-round role overrides

`reviewer_after_round` and `fixer_after_round` are opt-in overlays for long
review loops, where the first pass is worth a stronger tier and later rounds are
mostly re-checking a fix the stronger model already prescribed. Each takes the
same `agent` / `model` / `effort` fields plus `after_round`: the number of
leading rounds that stay on the base role. `after_round` defaults to `1`, so the
overlay takes over from round 2.

```yaml
review_agents:
  fixer:
    agent: pi
    model: anthropic-vertex/claude-opus-4-8
  fixer_after_round:
    agent: pi
    model: google-vertex/gemini-3.8-flash
    after_round: 2
```

Rounds 1 and 2 above run on the `fixer` profile; round 3 and every later round
run on `fixer_after_round`. The direction is yours: point the overlay at a
cheaper tier to stop long loops from spending at the top tier, or at a stronger
one to escalate a loop that is not converging.

Without these keys nothing changes - every round runs on the role it runs on
today. They only select the harness for a round; they never change how many
rounds happen, and `auto_fix` plus the gate remain the only things that bound
the loop. The overlay applies to a round the pipeline numbered; an invocation
outside a numbered round keeps the base role. Only the base roles accept plain
`agent` / `model` / `effort` - setting `after_round` on `reviewer` or `fixer`, or
a value below 1, is a configuration error. Because a later-round fixer may be a
harness that cannot resume sessions, fixer session reuse is reported for every
fixer a run can use: configuring a non-resumable `fixer_after_round` turns fix
turns cold for the whole run rather than handing round 3 a session it cannot
resume. `no-mistakes stats --run <id>` shows the agent and served model per
invocation alongside its round, so which tier served which round is visible
after the fact.

Both roles can use the same harness with different models. Reviews and rereviews
always run fresh; only review fixes reuse the fixer's session when
`session_reuse` is enabled and the fixer supports it. These settings do not
select the agents repairing tests, documentation, or CI. An opt-in
[per-run Pi profile](#per-run-pi-profiles) supersedes these role values for
that run. Eval capture strips these profiles so replay candidates remain
authoritative.

### agent_args_override

Extra CLI flags to pass to each native agent.
Use this for anything [`agent_config`](#agent_config) does not cover - service tier, permission mode, profiles, or any other flag the underlying agent supports - and as the escape hatch for a harness whose model or effort flag no-mistakes cannot map. For model and reasoning effort on a mapped harness, prefer `agent_config`: one spelling instead of seven.

|         |                                                           |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Type    | `map[string][]string`                                     |

| Default | Empty (no extra flags)                                    |

User-supplied flags are normally inserted ahead of no-mistakes' managed flags, so your choices usually take precedence. Security suppression selected by trusted [`disable_project_settings`](/no-mistakes/reference/repo-config/#disable_project_settings) may be placed first while preserving a compatible operator pin. A few flags are reserved because no-mistakes depends on them to communicate with the agent - setting any of these returns a config error on load:

| Agent      | Reserved flags                                                                                              |

| `copilot`  | `-p`, `--prompt`, `--output-format`, `--no-color`                                                          |
| `antigravity` | `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, `--print`, `--json-schema`, `--output-format`, `--conversation`, `-c`, `--continue` |

For structured `codex` runs, no-mistakes also appends its own `--output-schema <tempfile>` after your overrides. Treat that flag as managed even though config validation does not currently reject it.
Deep Code and Qwen reserve prompt, output and session-control flags. Qwen also reserves ACP and worktree mode flags, since its gate worktree and process mode belong to no-mistakes. Provider selection and Qwen permission flags remain operator-configurable.

The Claude, Codex, Grok, Pi, and Antigravity session-control forms are reserved so no-mistakes can keep review-loop conversations deterministic: review turns stay session-free while the fixer keeps its own isolated durable session.

Smart defaults:

- For `claude`, supplying `--permission-mode` (or `--dangerously-skip-permissions`) suppresses the default `--dangerously-skip-permissions`.
- For `codex`, supplying `--ask-for-approval`, `--sandbox`, or `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` suppresses the default `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`.
- For `grok`, supplying `--permission-mode` or `--always-approve` suppresses the default `--permission-mode bypassPermissions`. No model flag is added: Grok uses its current configured default unless you explicitly set `-m` or `--model`.
- For `antigravity`, supplying `-t` or `--print-timeout` suppresses the default `--print-timeout 24h`.

Permission and sandbox flags affect the underlying agent, but they do not disable no-mistakes' pipeline prompt steering.
Pipeline agents are still told to keep intentional writes inside the worktree and avoid mutating system state outside it.

Example:

```yaml
agent_args_override:
  claude:
    - --model
    - sonnet
    - --permission-mode
    - acceptEdits
  codex:
    - -m
    - gpt-5.4
    - -c
    - service_tier="priority"
    - -c
    - model_reasoning_effort="low"
  grok:
    - --reasoning-effort
    - high
  rovodev:
    - --profile
    - work
  pi:
    - --provider
    - google
```

Do not put a model flag under `opencode` here: these flags go to `opencode serve`, which exits with usage on an unknown option. Use `agent_config.opencode.model` instead.

For Codex, `service_tier` and reasoning effort tune different things: `service_tier` selects the speed or priority lane, while reasoning depth is what [`agent_config`](#agent_config)'s `effort` sets (as `-c model_reasoning_effort`). no-mistakes reloads global config while setting up each run, so edits made before `no-mistakes axi run` apply to that run. An opt-in [per-run Pi profile](#per-run-pi-profiles) still keeps its pinned model and effort for that run's lifetime. For repeatable profiles, use separately initialized `NM_HOME` directories; each has its own `config.yaml` and no-mistakes state.

### forge_profiles

Optional machine-local routing for repositories that use different GitHub or GitLab identities. Keys are the raw host tokens recorded in the repository remote, including SSH aliases such as `github-personal`. Each entry must set exactly one provider config directory:

```yaml
forge_profiles:
  github-personal:
    gh_config_dir: ~/.config/gh-personal
  github-work:
    gh_config_dir: /Users/you/.config/gh-work
  gitlab-work:
    glab_config_dir: ~/.config/glab-work
    expected_login: team-bot
```

Paths must be absolute or begin with `~/`; environment variables and other shell expansion are not supported. Host keys are case-insensitive.

When a repository matches a profile, no-mistakes validates it before starting the pipeline and applies an immutable environment to every subprocess in that run: built-in provider commands, custom shell commands, agents, managed agent servers, and the run's Git commands together with any hooks or credential helpers they spawn. A GitHub profile sets `GH_CONFIG_DIR` and removes higher-precedence GitHub token, host, and repository variables; a GitLab profile does the equivalent for `GLAB_CONFIG_DIR` and GitLab variables. The daemon process environment is never changed.

Each selected GitHub config must contain the target host and exactly one account for it, with that account active. A selected GitLab config must contain the target host. An optional `expected_login` pins the account name the profile must be signed in as; resolution fails closed when the config's active login differs or is missing, so a swapped or re-authenticated config directory can never route a run through the wrong account. It carries an account name only, never credentials. `no-mistakes doctor` validates every configured profile and its online authentication.

Profile activation is provider-specific and fail-closed: after at least one GitHub profile is configured, a GitHub repository must match a GitHub profile; GitLab remains ambient unless a GitLab profile is also configured, and vice versa. With no `forge_profiles`, provider detection and ambient CLI authentication behave exactly as before.

For a GitHub fork, no-mistakes considers both the parent and fork host tokens. A match on either side is sufficient. If both match, they must select the same account: the same effective provider config directory *and* the same `expected_login` pin. Otherwise startup fails as ambiguous, so two host tokens sharing a config directory while pinning different logins can never silently resolve to one of them. Fork PR topology itself is unchanged.

Deliberate scope boundaries, so profiles never duplicate what other layers own:

- **Commit identity stays with Git.** Author and committer for pipeline fix commits come from the effective Git configuration (for example remote-keyed `includeIf` sections), which resolves naturally inside run worktrees. Profiles carry no name/email fields.
- **Two accounts on the same host are distinguished by remote host tokens.** Give each account its own SSH alias (`github-personal`, `github-work`) and key a profile per alias; a profile cannot disambiguate two accounts behind one identical remote URL.
- **Executable selection stays with the machine.** Which `gh`, `glab`, or `git` runs is owned by `PATH` and the existing command resolution, not by profile configuration.
- **Credential-helper context stays with Git configuration.** Profiles point at provider CLI config directories and never model or store credential material; credentials remain in the CLI's own store.

### ci_timeout

How long the CI step monitors an open PR, including provider CI status and on GitHub, GitLab, Forgejo, or Azure DevOps PR mergeability, before giving up.

|         |                                                 |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Type    | `string` (Go duration, or an unlimited keyword) |
| Default | `168h` (7 days)                                 |

Accepts any Go `time.ParseDuration` string: `30m`, `2h`, `4h30m`, etc.

This is an idle timeout, not an absolute deadline: every time the base branch advances, the monitor re-arms it.
So an actively-updated green PR keeps its monitor no matter how long it stays open.
If it later develops an actual GitHub, GitLab, Forgejo, or Azure DevOps merge conflict, the CI auto-fix path rebases it, revalidates from Review because rebasing cannot prove continuity with the reviewed head, and publishes it through Push, while a clean behind PR needs no command.
A genuinely idle/abandoned PR still parks at an approval gate after the timeout elapses.
While that CI gate is parked, the daemon continues bounded read-only PR-state checks.
If the PR is merged or closed externally, the stale gate completes automatically; an open, unknown, or temporarily unreachable PR remains parked for a user decision.

Set it to `unlimited` (`none`, `off`, and `never` are accepted aliases), `0`, or any non-positive duration to monitor until the PR is merged, closed, or the run is aborted with `no-mistakes axi abort --run <id>`.

Legacy alias: `babysit_timeout`.

### step_quiet_warning

How long a running or fixing step can go without recorded step-log or native-agent lifecycle activity before AXI status marks the step as quiet.

|         |                        |
| ------- | ---------------------- |
| Type    | `string` (Go duration) |
| Default | `10m`                  |

Accepts any positive Go `time.ParseDuration` string: `30s`, `5m`, `1h`, etc.
Non-positive values are ignored and keep the default.

This is observability only.
It does not cancel the step, change auto-fix behavior, or mark the run failed.
AXI renders the quiet signal in the `active_steps` table as part of `last_activity`, for example `quiet 12m3s ago: codex started pid=4242`.
For older active runs that do not yet have activity rows, AXI falls back to the step log file's modification time.

### agent_timeout

Maximum wall-clock time for one pipeline agent invocation that does not already have a more specific deadline.
This is the default-by-construction budget: Document, Lint, Rebase conflict repair, PR drafting, CI auto-fix, and any future agent-spawning step are bounded even if they forget to install their own timer.
Review still uses [`review_agent_timeout`](#review_agent_timeout) for each review or fix invocation, Test still uses [`test_agent_timeout`](#test_agent_timeout) per invocation, and Intent keeps its five-minute extraction cap; any existing deadline is honored rather than capped.
When this deadline expires, the agent is cancelled and the invocation returns a timeout diagnostic instead of remaining active indefinitely. Most agent-driven mutation steps fail the run, CI auto-fix parks for a user decision, and PR drafting follows its existing agent-error fallback and continues with deterministic content. The [CI step reference](/no-mistakes/reference/pipeline-steps/#ci) owns the approval behavior.
A late successful return after the deadline is rejected, so post-agent commits and PR content cannot use work from a timed-out turn.

The diagnostic identifies expiration as an **absolute wall-clock limit** and separately reports what activity was actually measured. Activity does not reset or extend the hard limit. Evidence resets whenever a retry or fallback starts a replacement attempt, including provider fallback, failed session resume, and OpenCode's prompt-only structured-output fallback, so the diagnostic describes only the attempt that reached the deadline:

- `agent produced no output at all in 30m0s after its subprocess started (pid=1234)` - the current attempt launched and then emitted nothing. Check that the agent CLI is authenticated and responsive.
- `agent last produced output 4s ago (312 observed)` - the current attempt was working right up to the deadline. The turn needs a larger budget, or the request is too large for one turn.
- `agent produced no output at all in 30m0s and never reported a subprocess start` - the current attempt never reached a running agent process.

Output means anything observable: streamed assistant text, or raw bytes on the agent subprocess's stdout or stderr. Subprocess bytes matter because an agent spends most of a long turn running tools rather than writing prose, so prose alone cannot tell a working agent from a wedged one.
There is no activity-reset idle watchdog: [`step_quiet_warning`](#step_quiet_warning) is a separate status-only signal and does not cancel work. The absolute limit is the bounded safety policy for both active and no-output invocations.
Any substantive report from the agent adapter - for a native agent, its exit status and captured stderr - is appended to the diagnostic as `agent reported: ...`; credential-bearing URLs are redacted and the report is length-bounded before it can reach logs or findings. A bare context cancellation is omitted because it adds no evidence.

|         |                        |
| ------- | ---------------------- |
| Type    | `string` (Go duration) |
| Default | `30m`                  |

Accepts any positive Go `time.ParseDuration` string: `5m`, `30m`, `1h`, etc.
Non-positive values are rejected when loading the global config.
Raise it for repositories whose document, lint, rebase, PR, or CI-fix agent turns legitimately run long.
It is global-only: repository config and environment variables cannot override it.

### review_agent_timeout

Maximum wall-clock time for **one** Review-step agent invocation.
The optional fixer gets the full configured limit, and its fresh, session-free independent rereviewer gets a new full limit of its own. Every later fixer and rereviewer does the same; no invocation inherits time spent by an earlier turn.
When an invocation reaches this absolute deadline, the review agent is cancelled and the run fails with a diagnostic naming the wall-clock limit instead of remaining active indefinitely.
That diagnostic carries the same measured evidence and adapter report described under [`agent_timeout`](#agent_timeout).

|         |                        |
| ------- | ---------------------- |
| Type    | `string` (Go duration) |
| Default | `30m`                  |

Accepts any positive Go `time.ParseDuration` string: `5m`, `30m`, `1h`, etc.
Non-positive values are rejected when loading the global config.
Raise it for repositories whose reviews legitimately run long; it bounds only the Review step, and no other step or environment variable overrides it.

### test_agent_timeout

Maximum wall-clock time for one Test-step agent invocation.
The budget covers the post-test evidence-gathering turn, and a Test-repair turn gets its own budget of the same length.
When the deadline expires, the test agent is cancelled and the Test step parks for a decision with an ask-user finding rather than failing the run as a code defect.
That finding carries the same measured evidence and adapter report described under [`agent_timeout`](#agent_timeout).
A late structured result from the expired turn is still not used as a successful Test pass.
The park keeps the configured `commands.test` result from the same execution, so approving over a failing command is still recorded as a configured-command override.
A cut fix round also keeps the findings of the gate it was answering, selected or not, and the last completed evidence turn's verdict, so approving it is recorded against that verdict.
A commit the timed-out agent already made is recorded locally for custody and is not pushed, unless an unfinished rebase or merge leaves only a partial HEAD.
While the run worktree holds uncommitted changes or commits past the head the last completed evidence turn saw (before one completes, past the head the first cut measured from, which each later park carries forward and measures again), the park names them with the commands to inspect them and approval is refused, because the steps after Test would commit and publish them.
Otherwise approving the park is a Test exception (`passed-with-override`), not a silent green pass.
A fix response spends another budget: a repair turn runs only for selected findings other than the budget cut itself, then validation re-runs over whatever the cut left.
Guidance you attach to the budget-cut finding itself (`axi respond --instructions`, or `e` in the TUI) is given to that re-run validation.
You can also abort, raise this value, and retry.

|         |                        |
| ------- | ---------------------- |
| Type    | `string` (Go duration) |
| Default | `30m`                  |

Accepts any positive Go `time.ParseDuration` string: `5m`, `30m`, `1h`, etc.
Non-positive values are rejected when loading the global config.
Raise it for repositories whose targeted tests or evidence gathering legitimately run long; a suite that itself takes close to 30 minutes leaves almost no slack against provider slowness under the default.
The shipped default stays a stall bound and is not raised automatically.
It bounds only the Test step, and no other step or environment variable overrides it.

### daemon_connect_timeout

Maximum time a CLI client waits for an existing daemon socket to accept a connection before failing instead of hanging. Guards against a daemon process that is alive but stuck or unresponsive.

|         |                        |
| ------- | ---------------------- |
| Type    | `string` (Go duration) |
| Default | `3s`                   |

Accepts any positive Go `time.ParseDuration` string. Overridable per-invocation with the `NM_DAEMON_CONNECT_TIMEOUT` environment variable; see [Environment Variables](/no-mistakes/reference/environment/#nm_daemon_connect_timeout).

### branch_sync_remote_timeout

Maximum time guarded branch synchronization (`sync`, `axi sync`, and the TUI's sync action) waits for each remote Git operation - `ls-remote` or `fetch` - before remote verification fails closed and synchronization is refused.

|         |                        |
| ------- | ---------------------- |
| Type    | `string` (Go duration) |
| Default | `60s`                  |

Accepts any positive Go `time.ParseDuration` string.

Raise this if your environment's Git credential helper (for example `gh auth git-credential`, invoked by Git as a child process against a private remote) legitimately takes longer than the default - this is a real, non-outage latency characteristic that has been observed taking 19-22s in some environments, not a hang. It is a machine/environment setting, not a per-repository one: it is read only from global config and has no matching field in a repository's `.no-mistakes.yaml`, so a pushed branch cannot widen or narrow how long the local service waits before failing closed. It never changes the fail-closed guarantee itself - a timeout or unknown remote state still always refuses synchronization without changing files or refs, whatever this value is set to.

### gate_reconcile_interval

How often the daemon rechecks a parked approval gate while waiting for user approval. Today this applies to the CI step's parked gate, which re-probes provider availability (including `gh auth status`) and clears the gate when the PR was merged or closed.

|         |                        |
| ------- | ---------------------- |
| Type    | `string` (Go duration) |
| Default | `2m`                   |

Accepts any positive Go `time.ParseDuration` string. Global-only: there is no matching field in a repository's `.no-mistakes.yaml`.

### gate_reconcile_timeout

Maximum wall time one parked approval-gate reconcile attempt may spend before the attempt stops, the gate stays parked, and the next interval wait begins. Covers host probes such as `gh auth status` that can hang without returning.

|         |                        |
| ------- | ---------------------- |
| Type    | `string` (Go duration) |
| Default | `30s`                  |

Accepts any positive Go `time.ParseDuration` string. Global-only: there is no matching field in a repository's `.no-mistakes.yaml`. Raise this if a legitimate credential helper or network path routinely needs longer than the default for auth probes during reconcile. Timeout and interruption are reported distinctly from authentication failure; that distinction does not require raising this value.

### log_level

Daemon log verbosity.

|         |                                  |
| ------- | -------------------------------- |
| Type    | `string`                         |
| Values  | `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` |
| Default | `info`                           |

### session_reuse

Per-run agent session reuse for the review loop's fixer role.

|         |        |
| ------- | ------ |
| Type    | `bool` |
| Default | `true` |

When enabled and every fixer that can serve the run supports native session resume (Claude or Grok via `--resume`, Codex via `exec resume`, Pi via `--session <UUID>`, Antigravity via `--conversation <id>`), each run keeps one durable fixer session across its review-fix turns. A configured later-round fixer that cannot resume therefore makes all fixer turns cold for that run; see [later-round role overrides](#later-round-role-overrides).
Review turns - the initial full review and every full rereview - always run as fresh invocations regardless of this setting. They are also session-free, unless the run has a [review conversation](/no-mistakes/reference/repo-config/#reviewconversation) AND this setting is on, in which case one reviewer session spans exactly one review pass - the asking turn and the finalize turn that receives its answers - and never a code change; with `session_reuse: false` that finalize turn runs cold, which costs a re-read rather than the answers, because the finalize prompt is the complete review prompt plus the answers. Either way a rereview certifies fixes that implement the previous review turn's findings, so it must never resume the session that prescribed them; cross-round review context travels only in the explicit sanitized round history.
The fixer session is never lent to review turns, other pipeline steps stay session-isolated in their own cold invocations, and different runs never reuse identities.
When resume is unavailable or fails, the fix turn falls back to a cold run or a fresh fixer session and the fallback is recorded in the local `agent_invocations` performance record. Pi emits per-invocation usage after a resume, unlike Codex's cumulative session counters.
Session identities are persisted only as minimum local resume metadata, never as prompts or transcripts; Pi's own session directory retains its native transcript. Keep Pi's session directory private, and keep any `--session-dir` or `PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR` setting stable while a run is active so a daemon restart can find the fixer session.
The [daemon crash-recovery reference](/no-mistakes/concepts/daemon/#crash-recovery) owns which parked gates can resume or reconcile after a restart.
Set `false` to force every agent invocation cold.

### worktree_roots

Where a repository's pipeline run worktrees are created.

|         |                                                 |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Type    | `map[string]string`                             |
| Keys    | Absolute registered checkout paths (what you ran `no-mistakes init` in) |
| Values  | Absolute directory paths                        |
| Default | Empty (`<NM_HOME>/worktrees/<repo id>/<run id>`) |

By default a run worktree is created under `NM_HOME`, outside every checkout, so directory-scoped toolchain configuration (mise, direnv) never reaches it: those tools resolve their settings by path ancestry.
Point a checkout at a directory of your own and its runs are created at `<value>/<run id>` instead, inheriting whatever that directory configures.
A relative value is rejected at load time, because the daemon that reads it has an unrelated working directory.

The directory stays yours. no-mistakes never enumerates it: the only directories it touches there are the exact ones its own run records name, which is what startup cleanup, orphan-process reaping, and `no-mistakes eject` all go by. Anything else in it - your files, your scratch checkouts, and a directory that merely looks like a run worktree but no run created - is never read, never swept, never signalled, and never removed.

Each checkout needs its own root: two entries pointing at the same directory, two spellings of one checkout, or a root equal to its checkout are rejected at load time, and `init --worktree-root` refuses a directory another checkout already claims.

Two more values are refused at daemon startup, because they cannot work:

- **Inside `NM_HOME`.** It collides with no-mistakes' own state - under `worktrees` a run worktree is indistinguishable from the per-repository directories the default placement owns, and under `logs` a run's worktree *is* its log directory, so removing the worktree at run end would take the run's logs with it.
- **Inside any checkout.** The run worktree is then an untracked directory in that checkout while the run executes, so the checkout is dirty and [branch synchronization](/no-mistakes/reference/cli/#no-mistakes-sync) refuses to move it until the run finishes. That holds whether the victim is the checkout whose own runs land there or an unrelated gated one, so the daemon refuses a root inside any repository it has registered. Registering a repository *around* an already configured root is refused by `no-mistakes init` itself, so you can still place that checkout elsewhere or repoint the entry; anything that reaches the configuration another way is caught at the next daemon start.

Changing an entry affects new runs only.
Each run records the directory it was created in, so editing, adding, or removing an entry never retargets a run that already exists - resuming it after a restart, reading its diff, cleaning it up, reaping processes left standing in it, and ejecting its repository all keep using the directory that run actually has, including after you point the checkout somewhere else.

The key is matched against the checkout path recorded at `init`. After moving a checkout, re-run `no-mistakes init` from the new path and update the key; a key that matches no registered repository is reported in the daemon log at startup and otherwise does nothing.

`no-mistakes init --worktree-root <dir>` prints the exact entry to add for the checkout you are initializing. The global config is hand-maintained, so init never rewrites it for you.

### agent_git_proxy

Experimental integration for a session launcher's Git proxy. This global-only
setting is absent by default; repository configuration cannot enable or alter it.
It supports admitted task-branch publication to GitLab on macOS and Linux, with
canonical publication admitted through the existing launcher publisher.

```yaml
agent_git_proxy:
  git_binary: /absolute/path/to/real/git
  context_file: /absolute/path/to/session/git-proxy-context.json
```

The launcher supplies a private task context containing the exact admitted intent,
assignment, session, checkout, integration branch and publication destination.
Its live claim projection must still match, remain held and healthy, and have an
unexpired lease. Missing or changed context blocks publication.

The external Git proxy invokes the hidden `agent-push` controller entrypoint for
a normal task-branch push. The controller initializes registration, drives AXI,
checks durable gate results, publishes the exact validated head, and reconciles
the author's worktree through guarded synchronization. Retries reuse the launch
identity; a completed publication can be reused only with matching durable
evidence and a fresh live-remote check.

This mode requires Intent, Rebase, Review, Document, Lint and repository gates;
caller-provided skips cannot omit them. The built-in Test, PR and CI steps are
always skipped. Only the executor's final publication uses `git_binary` directly;
that selection is not an environment bypass inherited by pipeline agents.
Unresolved findings, overrides, incomplete evidence or a changed destination
prevent the remote mutation. Successful publication produces a private JSON
receipt under `NM_HOME/git-push-receipts` without the raw intent.

GitLab publication requests `ci.skip` for the branch-push pipeline. This does
not suppress merge-request pipelines. The external workflow must select and
verify its one required full CI graph, manage MR creation, and enforce independent
review and merge admission. This setting alone does not prevent duplicate MR and
integration-branch pipelines, establish independent reviewer approval, or authorize
canonical-branch publication.

For this integration-CI mode, both the freshly fetched integration branch and the
published commit must start their project-owned workflow rules with these two
refusals (either order), followed by an unconditional rule admitting the configured
integration branch. An inherited or conditional refusal is insufficient:

The published candidate must contain the current integration revision. A moved
integration branch requires another rebase and validation. A separate release or
default branch remains the trusted repository-config authority and need not carry
the integration branch's CI file.

```yaml
workflow:
  rules:
    - if: '$CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"'
      when: never
    - if: '$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH =~ /^task\//'
      when: never
    - if: '$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "dev"'
```

Existing stage and release branch rules follow normally. The proxy checks this
contract before remote mutation and fails closed if it is missing. Activating a
workflow with CI owned by the MR requires a separately accepted validation mode.

A canonical push must contain the exact head of a completed, clean task run
bound to the same assignment. It reuses that evidence rather than running AXI
again. Hosted `git publish` additionally calls the startup-bound publisher with
that validated SHA; the worker refuses a workspace whose head has changed.
Normal branch protections, publication authority and independent MR review
requirements still apply. A configured proxy refuses ordinary worktree creation
if the launcher's strict CoW creator is missing.

### auto_fix

Maximum follow-up auto-fix attempts per step. Set a step to `0` to disable the follow-up auto-fix loop, so findings require manual approval.
The document step attempts documentation fixes during its initial pass, so unresolved documentation findings pause for approval instead of using an automatic follow-up loop.
For empty `commands.lint`, the document step's combined housekeeping pass also attempts safe lint fixes, and the lint step consumes its result; unresolved blocking lint findings then pause for approval instead of starting another automatic fix loop.

Legacy alias: `auto_fix.babysit`.

These are global defaults. Per-repo config can override individual steps.

### ci.rerun_transient

How many times the CI step may re-run a single provider-attributed check before that check reaches an approval gate.
This covers cancellations on supported providers and, when the value is positive, opts GitHub into detecting jobs that failed before any repository step ran.

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | `int` |
| Default | `0` |
| Range | `0` to `5`; values outside it are clamped |

```yaml
ci:
  rerun_transient: 0
```

Each rerun is another provider-side workflow run billed to the repository being contributed to.
Set `0` here to never spend someone else's CI minutes; this is the only place to make that choice for a repository whose default branch you do not control.

The per-repo [`ci.rerun_transient`](/no-mistakes/reference/repo-config/#cirerun_transient) overrides this value and owns the classification, the trust boundary, and every case that skips the rerun.

### ci.revalidate_repairs

The operator-level fallback for [`ci.revalidate_repairs`](/no-mistakes/reference/repo-config/#cirevalidate_repairs), whose per-repository reference owns the repair-delivery semantics, safety rationale, and trust boundary.

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | `bool` |
| Default | `false` |

```yaml
ci:
  revalidate_repairs: false
```

A value in the trusted repository config overrides this global value in both directions: an explicit repository `true` enables revalidation when this is `false`, and an explicit repository `false` disables opt-in revalidation when this is `true`. When the trusted repository config omits the key, this global value applies.

### rebase.strategy

The operator-level default for [`rebase.strategy`](/no-mistakes/reference/repo-config/#rebasestrategy), whose per-repository reference owns the semantics, the trade-off, and the trust boundary.

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | `string` (`rebase` or `merge`) |
| Default | `rebase` |

```yaml
rebase:
  strategy: merge
```

A value in the trusted repository config overrides this global value in both directions. When the trusted repository config omits the key, this global value applies. An unrecognized value fails the config closed rather than falling back to the default, so a typo cannot quietly keep rewriting history a maintainer asked to stop rewriting.

### commit.fix_message

Template for the subject of commits created by the Review, Test, Document, Lint, and CI repair paths, plus operator-authorized repository gate repairs.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Type | `string` |
| Default | `no-mistakes({{.Step}}): {{.Summary}}` |

The template supports literal text and three Go-style placeholders:

| Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `{{.Step}}` | Pipeline step name, such as `review`, `test`, `document`, `lint`, `ci`, or `gate.test.mutation-budget` |
| `{{.Summary}}` | Sanitized one-line summary returned by the fix agent, or the step's deterministic fallback summary |
| `{{.Branch}}` | Normalized branch name, or the identifier captured and optionally transformed by [`commit.branch_pattern`](#commitbranch_pattern) and [`commit.branch_replacement`](#commitbranch_replacement) |

The value must be a valid UTF-8 template that renders to a non-empty, single-line commit subject.
The template source is limited to 1,024 bytes and 16 placeholders.
The fix-agent summary and final rendered subject are each limited to 4,096 bytes.
Before rendering, no-mistakes predicts the subject size from the validated literal text and placeholders, then rejects oversized output without allocating the expanded message.
Template functions, control actions, named templates, unknown placeholders, malformed syntax, control characters, unsafe Unicode format characters, and Unicode line or paragraph separators cause configuration loading to fail.
The blocked format set includes every Unicode `Bidi_Control` code point plus `U+00AD`, `U+180E`, `U+200B`, `U+2060` through `U+2064`, the deprecated bidi controls `U+206A` through `U+206F`, `U+FEFF`, `U+FFF9` through `U+FFFB`, and Unicode tag characters in `U+E0000` through `U+E007F`.
Legitimate `U+200C` zero-width non-joiner and `U+200D` zero-width joiner text shaping remains allowed.
The final rendered subject is validated again, so unsafe characters in an agent-provided summary are also rejected.
The setting does not change commit subjects created by the Rebase or Push steps.
A per-repo [`commit.fix_message`](/no-mistakes/reference/repo-config/#commitfix_message) value overrides this global setting.

### commit.branch_pattern

Optional regular expression for extracting the value exposed as `{{.Branch}}` to commit and PR title templates.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Type | `string` regular expression |
| Default | Unset, so `{{.Branch}}` is the normalized full branch name |

The expression is limited to 1,024 bytes, must be valid UTF-8, must exclude the same control and unsafe Unicode format characters as `commit.fix_message`, and must compile with exactly one capture group.
Without [`commit.branch_replacement`](#commitbranch_replacement), that capture group becomes `{{.Branch}}`, so `([A-Z]+-[0-9]+)` extracts `PROJ-123` from `feature/PROJ-123-add-widget`.
For example, this global configuration renders `PROJ-123: preserve legacy drafts` from branch `PROJ/123`:

```yaml
commit:
  branch_pattern: '^PROJ/([0-9]+)$'
  branch_replacement: 'PROJ-${1}'
  fix_message: "{{.Branch}}: {{.Summary}}"
```

When a template uses `{{.Branch}}` and the pattern does not find a non-empty identifier, rendering fails safely instead of producing an empty prefix.
A per-repo [`commit.branch_pattern`](/no-mistakes/reference/repo-config/#commitbranch_pattern) value overrides this global setting.

### commit.branch_replacement

Optional expression that adds literal text around the branch pattern's capture group before exposing it as `{{.Branch}}`. Set it under global `commit` for the machine-wide default, or under a matching [`repository_overrides`](#repository_overrides) entry for one remote. It is not available in a repository's `.no-mistakes.yaml`.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Type | `string` replacement expression |
| Default | Unset, so the capture group is used unchanged |

Use exactly one `${1}` reference to insert the capture group; other dollar syntax is rejected.
Under global `commit`, the replacement must be configured with `commit.branch_pattern` in that block. Under `repository_overrides`, pair it with `commit.branch_pattern` in the same remote entry.
It is limited to 1,024 bytes, must be valid UTF-8, and must exclude the same control and unsafe Unicode format characters as `commit.fix_message`.
Malformed replacement syntax fails configuration loading with an actionable error.
The expanded identifier is subject to the existing UTF-8, control-character, unsafe-Unicode, and rendered-subject validation.
A `commit.branch_pattern` in `.no-mistakes.yaml` takes precedence and clears any inherited machine-wide replacement, including one from a matching repository override, so a replacement cannot be applied to a different pattern.

### repository_overrides

Machine-local settings scoped to one repository by remote host and full repository path.
This lets one machine apply ticket conventions to a single repository without adding settings to that repository.
Remote hosts are matched case-insensitively.
HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, and Git-protocol URLs, plus scp-style remotes, are accepted; the transport scheme is not part of the match.
A URL's scheme-default port (80, 443, 22, or 9418 for HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, or Git) matches an omitted port; non-default ports remain distinct.
IPv6 addresses are canonicalized, with bracket boundaries preserved so a port cannot be confused with address text.
For `github.com`, `gitlab.com`, and `bitbucket.org`, repository paths are also matched case-insensitively and without a trailing `.git`, across equivalent HTTPS, SSH URL, and scp-style remotes.
On every other host, repository path case and a trailing `.git` are significant.
GitLab subgroup paths are preserved.
On other SSH hosts, rooted paths (`host:/...` or `ssh://host/...`) remain distinct from home-relative scp paths (`host:...`).

```yaml
repository_overrides:
  https://github.com/acme/widget.git:
    commit:
      branch_pattern: '([A-Z]+-[0-9]+)'
      fix_message: '{{.Branch}}: {{.Summary}}'
    pr:
      title_format: '{{.Branch}}: {{.Title}}'
```

Supported fields are `commit.branch_pattern`, `commit.branch_replacement`, `commit.fix_message`, and `pr.title_format`; each retains the same fail-closed validation as its global or repository-config equivalent.
A `commit.branch_replacement` must be paired with `commit.branch_pattern` in the same override.
Precedence is explicit: `.no-mistakes.yaml` wins for every field it sets, then a matching machine-local override, then the plain global value, then the built-in default.
As with the global replacement, a repository `commit.branch_pattern` replaces the matching machine-local pattern and clears its replacement.
Repositories matching no block keep existing global and built-in behavior.

### intent

Transcript-based user-intent extraction settings.
When enabled and no intent was supplied directly for the run, no-mistakes can read recent local agent transcripts, match the session that produced the change, summarize the author's intent, and pass that summary to rebase, review, test, document, lint, CI auto-fix, repository gate repair, and PR prompts. For publication of the generated Intent section, see [`pr.publish_intent`](/no-mistakes/reference/repo-config/#prpublish_intent).

|      |          |
| ---- | -------- |
| Type | `object` |

| Field                     | Type       | Default | Description                                                |
| ------------------------- | ---------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `intent.enabled`          | `bool`     | `true`  | Enable transcript-based intent extraction                  |
| `intent.threshold`        | `float`    | `0.2`   | Minimum raw match score for selecting a transcript session |
| `intent.slack_days`       | `int`      | `3`     | Extra days to look back before the change window           |
| `intent.disabled_readers` | `string[]` | Empty   | Transcript readers to disable                              |
| `intent.publish_intent`   | `bool`     | `true`  | Publish the generated Intent section on PR bodies by default |

Valid `disabled_readers` values are `claude`, `codex`, `opencode`, `rovodev`, `pi`, and `copilot`.

`intent.publish_intent: false` is a global, operator-side default that keeps the generated `## Intent` section out of the PR body for runs started without an explicit override. It is the caller-side counterpart of the repository's trusted [`pr.publish_intent`](/no-mistakes/reference/repo-config/#prpublish_intent): both are tighten-only, the repository's trusted policy remains the ceiling a caller can never exceed, and review, test, document, lint, and CI auto-fix prompts keep the full intent. Under the caller-side omission the PR-drafting turns receive no intent text at all and draft from the diff and commit messages only; the intent is withheld from them, never scanned out of their output. A run records the folded decision (the `axi run --no-publish-intent` flag OR this global default) at start; reruns inherit it, and a mid-run config change never re-publishes. This field is global-only: a pushed branch's `.no-mistakes.yaml` cannot express it.

The match score is the share of matching files mentioned in a transcript session; deleted files are ignored when the diff also contains non-deleted changes.
All-deletion diffs still match against the deleted changed files.
Mentioning extra files does not reduce the score.
For multi-file diffs, no-mistakes still requires at least two overlapping files and an effective minimum score of `0.5`.
Partial matches older than 24 hours are rejected unless their raw score is at least `0.8`.
If exactly one accepted candidate has a raw score of at least `0.85`, that decisive candidate wins before recency ranking.
Otherwise, accepted candidates are ranked by confidence, which combines the raw score with a small recency boost, with ties going to the most recent matching session, and ambiguous accepted candidates may be disambiguated by the configured pipeline agent.

### test.evidence

Test-step evidence storage settings.
By default, evidence artifacts are written to `<NM_HOME>/evidence/<run-id>`. On GitHub.com/GHEC, supported image and video artifacts are also uploaded when the PR is rendered; see `attach_media` below.

|      |          |
| ---- | -------- |
| Type | `object` |

| Field                         | Type     | Default                  | Description                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `test.evidence.store_in_repo` | `bool`   | `false`                  | Publish test evidence artifacts to the repository's orphan evidence branch |
| `test.evidence.attach_media`  | `bool`   | `true`                   | Upload image and video evidence to GitHub user-attachments when the PR is rendered |
| `test.evidence.dir`           | `string` | `.no-mistakes/evidence`  | Directory prefix inside the evidence branch                                |
| `test.evidence.branch`        | `string` | `no-mistakes/evidence`   | Name of the orphan evidence branch                                         |
| `test.evidence.local_root`    | `string` | `<NM_HOME>/evidence`     | Absolute directory where run evidence is written on local disk             |
| `test.evidence.retention`     | `string` | `336h` (14 days)         | How long a run's evidence survives; `unlimited`/`none`/`off`/`never` or a non-positive duration disables the bound |
| `test.evidence.max_runs`      | `int`    | `200`                    | How many run directories survive regardless of age; `0` disables the bound |

The test step always collects evidence outside the worktree, so artifacts never enter the branch under validation.
On GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise Cloud, image and video artifacts that pass GitHub's attach rules (png, jpg, jpeg, gif, webp, svg, mp4, mov, webm; images at most 10 MiB and videos at most 100 MiB) are uploaded to GitHub user-attachments when the PR body is rendered, unless `attach_media` is false and `store_in_repo` is also false.
The testing section embeds the returned image markdown or bare video URL so remote reviewers can open the media. Upload is fail-closed: any error, unsupported type, oversize file, GitHub Enterprise Server, non-GitHub forge, or GitHub App/Actions token keeps today's rendering (a commit-pinned evidence-branch link if `store_in_repo` published, otherwise a local path) rather than a dead attachment URL. Text artifacts stay inlined as they are today.
When `store_in_repo` is true for a GitHub repository, the PR step copies that directory onto `branch` under `<dir>/<branch-slug>` in the code branch's push-target repository (the fork when fork routing is configured), pushes it, and links the artifacts from the pull request body.
When both `attach_media` and `store_in_repo` apply, the testing section carries the user-attachments embed in addition to the commit-pinned git link.
The branch is an orphan: it shares no history with your code branches, so evidence never reaches the default branch. Links use the evidence commit rather than the branch, so they keep resolving after later runs.
Branch slashes become nested directories, unsafe branch characters are replaced, and an empty branch slug falls back to the run ID.
`branch` must be a valid Git branch name; an invalid value fails the config with the offending key and value.
The publisher never force-pushes. It appends to the fetched evidence-branch tip with a fast-forward push, retries one lost race, and refuses to use the run branch, default branch, or an existing branch whose tip lacks the `.no-mistakes-evidence` marker.
Publication is also refused when the remote cannot be read or pushed, an artifact exceeds 64 MiB, a run exceeds 500 files or 256 MiB, or another writer wins the retry. The PR body then keeps its local rendering instead of adding links that would not resolve.
Evidence-branch publication currently supports GitHub links only. On other providers, no evidence branch is pushed and the PR body keeps its local rendering.
Enabling this pushes a branch to your remote, so pick a `branch` name your CI workflows do not build.

#### Local storage and cleanup

Evidence lives under the app root rather than the system temp directory. On Linux the daemon runs from a service unit that does not export `TMPDIR`, so the old temp-directory default resolved to the shared `/tmp`, which current Ubuntu mounts as a RAM-backed `tmpfs`. The app root is disk backed on macOS, Linux, and Windows alike.

no-mistakes reaps its recorded run directories itself rather than relying on an operating-system temp cleaner. Unrecognized directories under a custom `local_root` are left untouched.

- A finished run that produced no artifacts leaves nothing behind.
- Recorded run directories older than `retention` are removed.
- Whatever recorded run evidence survives is trimmed to `max_runs`, oldest first.
- A run that is still pending or running is never touched.

Reaping runs after each finished run and again at daemon startup. An upgraded daemon also drains the pre-relocation directory in the system temp directory under the same rules; nothing is migrated, because absolute paths recorded in older pull request bodies name the old location.

`local_root` must be an absolute path outside `<NM_HOME>/worktrees`; a relative or managed-worktree path fails daemon startup and prevents new or recovered runs from starting. Because `retention` bounds how long a PR body's local artifact links keep resolving, raise it rather than lowering it if your reviews run long.

The publication fields are global defaults. Repo config can override `store_in_repo`, `attach_media`, and `dir`; it can override `branch` only through the trusted default-branch copy. `local_root`, `retention`, and `max_runs` are global-only: a repository does not get to name a filesystem path this machine's daemon writes to, or set the retention budget for a directory every repository on the machine shares.

### eval

Local review-evaluation corpus settings for [`no-mistakes eval`](/no-mistakes/reference/eval/).

|      |          |
| ---- | -------- |
| Type | `object` |

| Field                     | Type   | Default | Description                                                            |
| ------------------------- | ------ | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `eval.capture_provenance` | `bool` | `true`  | Record the exact commit and configuration inputs a replay needs        |
| `eval.auto_capture`       | `bool` | `true`  | Collect eligible review cases and fixed CI false negatives automatically |
| `eval.max_cases`          | `int`  | `200`   | Retention target for automatic collection; `0` keeps every case        |
| `eval.diversified_size`   | `int`  | `32`    | Cap on the official gold-only `diversified` set; `0` is one gold case per stratum |

`capture_provenance` is what makes a review pass replayable at all. It is recorded when the round is written and cannot be added afterwards, because the pinned configuration is a point-in-time snapshot, so a run reviewed with it off can never be captured later.

`auto_capture` collects without any command: when an eligible run finishes, its decided review rounds become cases and fixed `ci-check` and `ci-review-bot` findings become Review false negatives. It does nothing while `capture_provenance` is off. Collection runs after the pipeline has already reported its outcome and can never change it; a failure is logged and nothing else. The [Evaluation toolkit](/no-mistakes/reference/eval/#how-cases-are-collected) owns eligibility and labeling details.

`max_cases` sets the retention target enforced after automatic collection. When it is exceeded the oldest unprotected cases are dropped first. A case with a replay in progress or recorded candidate replays is protected, so the corpus can remain above the target rather than invalidate a comparison you have spent tokens on. Cases from the same repository share one local object pool, so a case costs its own records plus the objects its commits introduced rather than a copy of the repository.

`diversified_size` caps the official gold-only eval set used by `eval run --cases diversified`. Selection is stratified and pinned; unlabeled cases never fill it. `0` keeps one gold case per stratum with no Hamilton bound. Corpus retention (`max_cases`) and this official-set cap are different knobs.

These are operator settings for this machine's local disk, so they are global-only: an `eval` block in a repository's `.no-mistakes.yaml` is ignored. Corpus storage stays under `<NM_HOME>/eval` and no-mistakes never uploads it; replay still sends code to the selected agent's configured model provider as described in the [Evaluation toolkit](/no-mistakes/reference/eval/).

### providers.github.draft_pull_requests

Open pull requests created on GitHub as drafts (`gh pr create --draft`).

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | `bool` |
| Default | `false` |

Only affects PR creation; existing PRs are not toggled between draft and ready. GitHub only — ignored for other providers.
This is a global default. Per-repo config can override it via `providers.github.draft_pull_requests`.

### providers.gitlab.draft_pull_requests

Open merge requests created on GitLab as drafts (`glab mr create --draft`).

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | `bool` |
| Default | `false` |

Only affects MR creation; existing MRs are not toggled between draft and ready. GitLab only — ignored for other providers.
This is a global default. Per-repo config can override it via `providers.gitlab.draft_pull_requests`.

### providers.bitbucket.draft_pull_requests

Open pull requests created on Bitbucket Cloud as drafts (`"draft": true` in the create-PR API request).

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | `bool` |
| Default | `false` |

Only affects PR creation; existing PRs are not toggled between draft and ready. Bitbucket only — ignored for other providers.
This is a global default. Per-repo config can override it via `providers.bitbucket.draft_pull_requests`.

### providers.azuredevops.draft_pull_requests

Open pull requests created on Azure DevOps as drafts (`az repos pr create --draft true`).

| | |
|---|---|
| Type | `bool` |
| Default | `false` |

Only affects PR creation; existing PRs are not toggled between draft and ready. Azure DevOps only — ignored for other providers.
This is a global default. Per-repo config can override it via `providers.azuredevops.draft_pull_requests`.
