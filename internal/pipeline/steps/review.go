	// The verification-discipline rules below (apply all fixes first, then one
	// focused verification of the changed area, and never run the whole repo
	// test/lint suite in the fixer round) exist for wall-clock reasons: a
	// forensic audit of a real multi-round run measured the fixer re-running the
	// entire test+lint suite ~5x per round (27 runs across 5 rounds, ~784s of
	// the 2419s review step), plus the model round-trips that poll those long
	// subprocesses. Review runs before the dedicated Test and Lint steps
	// (pipeline order in common.go), which are the authoritative test and lint
	// gates; their coverage may be focused when the repository has no configured
	// commands. The fixer prohibition stays universal because the fixer only
	// needs to confirm its own edits hold, not re-gate the whole repository. This
	// mirrors the same "relevant"-scoped, cross-tool-forbidden discipline the
	// test and lint fix prompts already carry. The instruction is a contract,
	// not an enforced sandbox - the agent has free shell access - so the pinned
	// regression tests guard the wording, not the runtime.
	//
	// The invariant-complete rule replaces the earlier "fix the reported
	// instance narrowly" wording. That wording was the same audit's second
	// finding: fix rounds told to reach "the deepest practical cause" answered
	// symptoms with new machinery, which the next rereview then found defects
	// in, which bred more machinery. Narrowing the fix to the instance stopped
	// the machinery but produced the opposite thrash: a measured SSHHIP run
	// (PR #462) and seven local runs had 58-65% of rereviews reporting a sibling
	// site the previous fix left behind (the other clamp axis, the Skip path
	// beside the Fix path, the same __proto__ map in a second file, the next
	// unvalidated field of one response) or a regression the fix itself made.
	// The unit of a fix is therefore the invariant, at every site in the
	// changed area where it must hold, closed with the same small correction or
	// at one shared boundary. Depth is still wanted - the preceding rule keeps
	// the local-defect-vs-deeper-flaw diagnosis - and machinery is still
	// forbidden: closing sibling sites is the fix, adding handling for symptoms
	// is not. The "deepest practical cause" wording does not return. Remedies
	// that must EXTEND the change instead of correcting it belong to the human
	// at the review gate, which is what the reviewer's remedy-scope
	// classification rule below routes them to. The self-trace rule after the
	// edits covers the other half of the measured thrash: a fix that makes the
	// reported sequence pass while breaking the ordinary path or a caller, and
	// residue (an alias or branch the fix made dead) the next review reports.
	//
	// The removal rule is the complement the anti-revert guard was missing.
	// That guard told the fixer to fix intentional code forward, and "the
	// author wrote it on purpose" is true of every unrequired branch, so a
	// finding inside one was always answered by hardening it (backpass PR #107:
	// six rounds patched around an any-existing-file acceptance branch that one
	// deleted line would have closed, and still missed). The guard now protects
	// only code the intent requires; a path the intent does not strictly
	// require is fixed by removing it. The intent is the arbiter for both, and
	// genuine doubt still leaves the code alone and reports the finding
	// unresolved.

Context:
- branch: %s
- base commit: %s
- target commit: %s
- review scope: %s
- default branch: %s
- ignore patterns: %s

Rules:
- Always start with double checking whether the findings are legitimate.
- Before changing code, identify whether each finding is a local defect or a symptom of a deeper design, abstraction, validation, ownership, or test-coverage flaw. Prefer the smallest correct root-cause fix within the changed area over patching only the reported line.
- Before changing code, state for each finding the invariant it violates (what must always hold, in one sentence) and enumerate every place in the changed area where that same invariant must hold: every axis, direction, and representation; every sibling call path, command, action, and state transition; every consumer of the same input, field, or record. Fix the invariant at all of those places in this round, with the same small correction, or at the one shared boundary that makes all of them hold. A fix that closes only the reported site and leaves a sibling site reachable is incomplete; the next review will report the sibling.
- Do not grow the fix into machinery: closing sibling sites with the same small edit, or moving a check to one shared boundary, is the fix; adding handling, state, fallbacks, retries, or a subsystem to manage symptoms is not. Prefer addressing a deeper architectural reason and simplifying it, than introducing machinery to handle the symptoms.
- Avoid resolving a finding by removing or reverting the author's intentional code in their original 1st commit when the intent requires that code. If the original change introduced something the intent requires, fix it forward (e.g. add validation, handle edge cases, tighten logic) rather than deleting it. Similarly, if the original change intentionally deleted or simplified code, do not restore or re-add the removed code unless the finding is a legitimate correctness, reliability, or security issue and the smallest reasonable fix happens to reintroduce a small amount of previously deleted logic. When in doubt about whether the intent requires the code, leave it and report the finding as unresolved.
- Do not add code comments explaining your fixes.
- Apply all the fixes you intend to make first; do not run any verification in between individual fixes.
- After applying the fixes and before verification, re-trace for each finding the concrete failing sequence it describes through the code as it now is, and trace the ordinary successful path through every function you changed, including each of its callers. Remove any alias, branch, parameter, or helper your fix made unreachable. A fix that makes the reported sequence pass while breaking the ordinary path, a caller's assumption, or a sibling site is a regression the next review will report.
- After all fixes are applied, run one focused verification limited to the changed area (the specific package, file, or test you touched) at the end of the fix round to confirm the fixes hold.
- Do NOT run the complete repository test suite or lint suite during this fix round. The pipeline has dedicated test and lint steps after review that are the authoritative test and lint gates; their coverage may itself be focused on the changed area when the repository has no configured test or lint commands.
- Return JSON with a single "summary" field when you are done.
- The summary must be one concise sentence fragment suitable for a git commit subject.
- Keep the summary under 10 words.%s

	// scope verifier would be exactly the machinery being prevented - and it
	// runs with the grain of ActionOrDefault, which already fails an
	// unclassified finding closed to ask-user.
	//
	// A finding names its class, not one site: the rule after the anchor rule
	// asks the reviewer to list, in the same finding, every other place in the
	// changed code where the same invariant is violated or must hold, and for
	// incomplete validation every consumed field still unvalidated. One finding
	// per site let a class be rediscovered one site per round (the other clamp
	// axis, the sibling command, the same map in a second file, the next
	// unvalidated field) while the fixer, told the instance, fixed the instance.
	// The list is prose in the description; the anchor stays one file and line
	// so the carry-forward set and finding identity are unchanged.
	//
	// Findings also require an intended-usage sequence. A rare but real path
	// those callers actually take still qualifies; a hypothetical unused
	// execution does not. This is an evidence threshold for what counts as a
	// finding, not a general instruction to emit fewer of them.
	//
	// The dedicated Simplification section asks a different question from the
	// defect pass: not "is this component correct" but "does the intent
	// require this component at all". A reviewed spiral (backpass PR #107)
	// showed why the defect pass alone cannot catch over-engineering: a
	// permissive resolver with seven acceptance branches and a second,
	// skill-only budget semantics each yielded a concrete, intended-usage
	// defect per round, so every finding cleared the evidence threshold and
	// every fix hardened the unrequired path instead of removing it, across
	// thirteen rounds that never converged. The section reports the unrequired
	// component itself as an ask-user warning whose remedy is removal, and asks
	// defect findings inside such a component to name removal too, so the
	// fixer's removal rule has something to act on. It stays ask-user because
	// whether extra surface is wanted is the author's call; the section
	// deliberately adds no schema field or second reviewer.

Context:
- branch: %s
- base commit: %s
- target commit: %s
- review scope: %s
- default branch: %s
- ignore patterns: %s

Task:
- Read the relevant history and diff yourself.
- Focus findings on risks introduced by changed code, but inspect surrounding code, call sites, shared helpers, tests, and invariants when needed to understand root cause.
- Determine from the stated intent and relevant evidence whether a bug-fix change claims a durable fix or explicitly authorized short-term containment.
- For a claimed durable fix, reconstruct the concrete failing sequence and required invariant, inspect relevant sibling paths and shared state transitions, and ask whether the same authorized failure remains reachable.
- For any new or changed logic, construct at least one concrete input or state and trace it through the code, looking for a case that produces a wrong result without erroring.
- When changed behavior reads, writes, returns, indexes, caches, logs, or otherwise processes potentially protected resources or user data, trace a concrete operation or disclosure across the relevant boundaries. Check where identity is established and whether unauthenticated execution remains reachable; whether authorization is enforced at the earliest shared boundary used by every caller; ownership, role, tenant, organization, and administrative scope including alternate call paths; public responses and serialization of private fields, PII, drafts, internal metadata, or reviewer/admin-only data; secondary disclosure through search projections, caches, logs, telemetry, error details, exports, and generated artifacts; and fail-open defaults, missing-context behavior, preview or bypass paths, and stale authorization assumptions.
- Report an authorization or privacy finding only with source-backed evidence of a concrete reachable operation or disclosure path. Identify the protected resource or field, the bypass or missing control, and the resulting unauthorized action or exposure. Do not infer a finding merely because middleware, an authorization call, or an auth-related test is absent by name; accept equivalent controls and intentionally public data when the source proves them.
- Repository instructions own access policy. If changed behavior introduces a concrete material operation or disclosure involving potentially protected resources or user data, and the instructions and source do not establish whether it is allowed, you MUST emit an "ask-user" finding that names the missing policy decision. Do not report immaterial or pre-existing ambiguity, and do not invent access policy. A source-proven routine defect retains the existing "auto-fix" semantics.
- When source evidence proves the failure remains reachable, report the concrete path and recommend the earliest supported shared boundary that would make the invariant hold, rather than duplicating another symptom patch.
- Do not infer a systemic flaw from code shape, duplication, or architectural preference alone. Do not demand a shared abstraction or broad redesign without a concrete reachable path, violated invariant, or immediately competing semantic owner.
- Report a finding only when you can construct a concrete sequence that occurs during the change's intended usage, including rare but real sequences those callers actually perform. Do not report a finding whose only supporting path is a hypothetical unused execution that intended callers, the public API, or documented usage never take.
- Do not block explicitly authorized honest containment merely because a later durable fix is possible. Do not expand user scope or turn optional broader improvements into blockers.
- Do NOT run tests during review. The pipeline has a dedicated test step after review.
- Analyze for bugs, risks, and code simplification opportunities.
- "Simplification" opportunities in this pass mean reducing code complexity through non-functional refactoring (e.g. deduplication, clearer control flow). They do NOT mean removing features, changing product behavior, or stripping intentional user-facing output; a component the intent does not require is reported through the dedicated Simplification section below, never as an "auto-fix" refactor.
- Treat security issues, performance regressions, breaking changes, insufficient error handling, and a computation that returns a wrong value, label, or set without failing as risks.
- Do a full review pass before returning. Do not stop after the first valid finding. Continue inspecting the rest of the changed code until you have enumerated all material issues you can substantiate.
- Report reviewed_paths as the exact set of changed files you actually read and judged in this pass. It is a coverage record, not a summary: list a changed file only if your findings verdict for it is current, and never list a file you did not examine. A file you omit is treated as unreviewed by the pipeline, never as clean.
%s
Rules:
- Anchor every finding to a specific file and one-indexed line number in the changed code when possible.
- When you report a defect, enumerate in that same finding every other place in the changed code where the same invariant is violated or must hold (another axis, direction, or representation; a sibling call path, command, action, or state transition; another consumer of the same input, field, or record), each as file:line with a few words. Report the class once, anchored at the primary site, instead of one site now and its siblings after the next fix. When the defect is incomplete validation of an input, response, or record, list every consumed field that is still unvalidated in that one finding.
- Use severity "error" for problems that should absolutely not get merged, "warning" for things that are worth addressing but can be done in a follow up, and "info" for things that are nice to have.
- Be concise and actionable. No generic advice like "add more tests".
- Only comment on things that genuinely matter.
- Do NOT report styling, formatting, linting, compilation, or type-checking issues.
- If the change is clean, return an empty findings array.
- For each finding, set the action field to one of:
  - "ask-user": the finding is about functional requirements or product behavior, or otherwise challenges the author's deliberate intent. Even if it seems obviously wrong, we should ask the user for review. Examples: "this feature seems unnecessary", "this hardcoded value should be configurable", "this deletion looks wrong". When in doubt, default to "ask-user".
  - "auto-fix": the finding is a non-functional, non user-visible issue (correctness, error handling, security, performance, mechanical code quality) that can be safely fixed without any discussion about the author's intent.
  - "no-op": the finding is informational and does not require any action (e.g. noting a pattern, acknowledging a tradeoff).
- Classify by the remedy, not only by the topic. If the smallest honest remedy for a finding would add new durable state, a schema change, new background, retry, or persistence machinery, a new subsystem, or otherwise EXTEND the change beyond its stated intent rather than CORRECT what it already does, the action must be "ask-user" even when the defect itself looks mechanical. Say in the description that the remedy, not the defect, is what needs authorization.
- For each finding, set review_scope to exactly one of:
  - "source": every source-verifiable finding, including any finding that mixes a source defect with a delivery claim.
  - "pipeline-owned-delivery": only a finding whose sole claim is that this run's remote branch, push, PR, or CI output is not present yet.
  - "external-delivery": a pre-existing or external PR, third-party artifact, or other lifecycle requirement not owned by this run.

Simplification (a dedicated pass over what the change introduced, in addition to the findings above):
- Enumerate every component the change introduced: a new branch, acceptance or matching path, fallback, alias, mode, flag, option, a second definition of a concept the code already defines once, or a parallel copy of a rule. Judge each one against the User intent when one is stated, otherwise against the change's own stated purpose. The stated purpose sets the required scope, not the implementation.
- For each component that is not strictly required to satisfy that intent, report a finding with severity "warning" and action "ask-user". Name the component, state that no intent requirement needs it or which requirement it exceeds, and recommend removing it as the remedy. Do not recommend hardening, validating, or documenting a component the intent does not require.
- When a defect you reported above lives inside such a component, say so in that finding and name removal of the component as the smallest honest remedy, instead of prescribing a repair that keeps the component and hardens it.
- Report each unrequired component once. When a component is required but a strictly narrower form satisfies the intent (for example an exact match where the change accepts several spellings), name the narrower form.

Risk assessment (after listing all findings):
- Assess source code, source-verifiable criteria, and enforceable external lifecycle requirements normally, while excluding findings scoped "pipeline-owned-delivery" from risk.
- Set risk_level to "low" if the change is well-bounded, mostly cosmetic, or straightforward with little ambiguity.
- Set risk_level to "medium" if the change has room to improve but is safe to merge first with concerns addressed as follow-ups.
- Set risk_level to "high" if the change should not be merged without explicit human approval - it is fundamental, risky, ambiguous, or has strong negative signals.
- Provide a one-sentence risk_rationale explaining why you chose that risk level.
- Set risk_scope to "source-or-external" when the assessment reflects source risk or enforceable external state, and to "pipeline-owned-delivery" only when it is based solely on a deferred outcome this run owns.%s%s%s%s`,

// defect in code a prior round changed, or a sibling site of an invariant a

// introduced it, left it behind, or moved it, and every remaining sibling site
// is listed in that one finding. Without the label the driver selects the one

// retraction is a claim the reviewer makes, and the executor records it where
// the finding's disappearance can be read back against it.
//
// Whether a round may retract at all is the executor's call, not this one's:
// it owns the outstanding set and applies this list only on a finalize turn.
